# Trading in Bitso

In this project I look to explore the API of Bitso, implement some algorithms for automatic and semi-automatic trading, Use data sources to make the predictions, deploy in a web service as "Python Anywhere" and set notifications for every trading. The final desirable result would be an API for trading with Bitso, seting some parameters which can be load in the algorithm designed.

## Designing Algorithm for trading

## Deploying in web server
